        "description": "An interval temporal network is a network whose edges are active for one or more time intervals and inactive the rest of the time. Work has been done previously on instantaneous connectivity of interval temporal networks, where the network is considered to be connected during a period of time [x,y], if it is connected for all time instances within the continuous time interval [x,y]. This project will look at the implementation of existing and possible development of new approaches to preserve connectivity of an interval temporal network over time (by maintaining a 'bank' of extra edges, available during certain time intervals, which can reconnect the network in case it becomes disconnected).",

This project will focus on the implementation and development of path finding algorithms for temporal graphs. The basis of the project will involve familiarising yourself and implementing existing work for computing shortest, fastest and foremost temporal paths. You will then progress to studying and exploring reachability problems in temporal graphs, such as Minimizing Reachability Times on Temporal Graphs via Shifting Labels (see work by Deligkas et al.) or Deleting edges to restrict the size of an epidemic in temporal networks (see work by Enright et al.).",

        "description": "Image enhancement techniques (e.g. Transforms, Filters, Operators, etc.) have been used for decades to improve the quality of images to enable better human analysis. This project intends to investigate the effects of such enhancement techniques on learning-based computer vision methods. We know that image processing techniques used to enhance the visual quality of the images do not actually add more information to the images and can only produce more visually pleasing results or extract specific features from images by manipulating information that is already contained within the image. Modern learning-based computer vision techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), however, receive raw images as their input and given enough training data should be able to learn their way around any visual changes in the image. As a result, it would make sense that image processing techniques, while used as data augmentation methods, should not make much of a difference in the actual performance of the neural network but besides intuition, there is little evidence of this in the literature. The parameters of the project will be decided by the student, but the overall goal is to identify how if at all image enhancement techniques can effect the performance of CNNs over various tasks. Experiments are required to identify performance with different image processing methods, different neural network architecture, transfer learning, pre-trained models, training from scratch, etc.",

        "description": "Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive image acquisition modality that uses low-coherence light to generate images at micrometer resolution [1]. Retinal OCT captures three-dimensional volumetric data with cross-sectional images (B-scans) to show the details of cellular layers in the retina [2]. Since manual annotation of retinal boundaries is time-consuming, subjective, and prone to error, automatic cell layer segmentation has been an active area of research in recent years [3,4]. However, even the most promising segmentation methods fail in some cases. The main problem is that 3D OCT of each patient consists of 100 to 500 B-scans and failing in correct segmentation of some images leads to problematic 3D reconstruction of the retinal cell layers, needed in subsequent treatment or diagnosis applications. The parameters of the project will be decided by the student but the overall aim of this project is to develop a learning-based supervised classification algorithm capable of categorising each segmented image as either correct or incorrect. The labelled data is available for this task and the performance of the network will be compared against an expert ophthalmologist. ",

        "description": "With development of AI methods, successful applications are introduced for retinal disease detection. Diagnosis of retinal abnormalities is essentially dependant on multimodal data, including 2D and 3D images with basic clinical information. However, current learning-based approaches often relies on large scale labelled data for training, which is oftentimes challenging especially for disease with low occurrence. Moreover, a model trained from dataset with one or a few diseases is unable to detect other unseen diseases, which limits the practical usage of the system in disease screening. This project focuses on a multimodal and multiscale solution for the identification of different diseases through anomaly detection. Different anomaly detection methods can be explored to help identify unseen and unknown diseases by taking advantage of healthy patient data only.\n",

AS poses significant threats to vision, making it crucial to understand its impact on the retina. Using state-of-the-art automatic segmentation techniques on in vivo 3D retinal imaging in one of the largest AS cohorts to date, we seek to uncover the full spectrum of retinal alterations in this condition with aid of deep learning algorithms. By uncovering the link between retinal cell rarefaction, foveal morphology, genetic factors, and systemic disease, we hope to shed light on the development of AS in the eye and kidney. This knowledge will have a profound impact on early detection, monitoring, and treatment planning for AS, ultimately improving patient care and outcomes.

However, these problems become extremely challenging when the scene is cluttered and contains irrelevant information that distracts the neural network. This is even true for humans, as evidenced by puzzle games such as \"Where's Wally?\", where the goal is to find the target in a cluttered scene. The objective of this project is to explore the effects of distractors on the performance of CNNs when attempting tasks such as object detection or semantic segmentation. The parameters of the project will be decided by the student, but the overall goal is to identify how if at all clutter hinders performance. Data can be generated on the fly by artificially introducing clutter into otherwise simple scenes. Where's Wally data can also be used as part of the analysis by identifying which part of the cluttered scene the CNN is paying attention to in presence of distractors.\n",

        "title": "Can surgery revitalize the eyes? ",
        "description": "The macula is a specialised region of the eye in which there is a very high packing density of cones, particularly in its centre, the fovea. The formation of the fovea is characterised by a migration, largely after birth, of the inner retinal layers away from the centre to form a pit with concurrent migration of cone photoreceptors inwards. The inward migration during childhood increases the cone packing density affording good visual acuity through adulthood. The process has been termed foveation and has not thought to be possible other than in development.\n\nA variety of disease and injuries can affect the centre of the fovea, including macular holes.  Full-thickness macular holes (FTMHs) are defects in the foveal centre involving all neural retinal layers. Their estimated prevalence is approximately 3 per 1000.  FTMHs reduce visual acuity and have a significant impact on quality of life. Surgical management with pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) is successful in closing macular holes and improving vision.  The mechanism of visual restoration has always been thought to be due to simple cone re-apposition but careful observation of macular hole patients after surgery suggest that a process analogous to foveation seen earlier in life may be an important process in the healing of macular holes. These findings may have significance in the potential restoration of acuity in other disorders involving the macula and may be amenable to therapeutic interventions.\n\nThis project will use deep learning and image processing methods to examine images pre and postoperatively of patients undergoing macular hole surgery to detect its occurrence and will also look at the association of preoperative and postoperative variables including visual acuity and RPE health, thought to be an important determinant of foveation in utero.

        "description": "Using advanced imaging techniques, we can capture cellular-resolution images of the living human retina, which is the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. This is not possible with the \u2018standard\u2019 instruments you may have seen at the optometrist and there are very few research labs with this capability. We can use the images captured by this instrument in a number of important clinical and non-clinical applications, from studying disease to investigating the workings of the human visual system. An important measurement that we need to make is the density of photoreceptor cells, as this is altered in many retinal diseases, having a devastating impact on a person\u2019s sight. Making these measurements accurately can help us understand these diseases better and possibly detect them earlier. But, labelling the large number of cells visible in these images is challenging. Doing this manually is time-consuming and prone to error, and the accuracy of automated approaches is variable and often needs a manual check of the output. This project will investigate two automated methods using neural networks, but unlike other published studies, it will use images from human participants and images generated via simulation [1] both to produce large training datasets and to properly characterise algorithm performance. This will help us to derive better metrics of cell density and arrangement that we can use to analyse images collected from patients with retinal disease.

        "title": "Electric Vehicle as a Service for Disaster-like Scenarios",
        "description": "Urban Areas or Cities are largely dependent on infrastructure specifically critical infrastructures (CIs) to provide a quality living standard, public services, economic development and good governance to the society. In emergency situations or in the case of disaster, Electric Vehicles (EVs) can act as mobile service providers wherein they can perform multifaceted roles as energy stores (can be used for charging and discharging of energy to/fro grid), data stores, edge nodes (for computation and processing), roadside communication units (can act as communication devices for data transmission) and many more. EVs can move around the urban areas to supply power to CIs and even act as mobile communication nodes which can provide connectivity. But, before deploying EVs in urban areas for handling emergency services and sustaining basic functionalities for CIs, there are many challenges which must be tackled or some novel solutions are required for the same. This project aims to develop a new framework and novel IoT data management techniques to support the development of next generation applications for restoring power to CIs during disaster situations. In case of disruption of cloud or even edge connectivity, the usage of EVs as an alternative edge-computing infrastructure and roadside units (RSU) as an alternative communication media needs will be investigated.  In this project, EVs can act as such computational chips, which can be utilised for data collection, storage and even processing if required. However, developing an integrated IoT-Edge-Cloud data processing framework and techniques for restoring power supply to CIs, specifically in disaster scenario, are faced with following hard research and technical questions: \n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\tWhat are the core data types, which need to integrate for achieving dynamic decision making as regards to EV mobilization and placement for protecting CIs during disaster situations?\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\tHow  to constantly monitor and handle the velocity, volume, and variety of IoT data from multiple sensor types (smart meters, temperature, humidity, appliances, light)  and roof-top photovoltaic farms (micro-grids) connected to CIs for building energy demand profiles? \n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\tHow to exploit combined edge-cloud infrastructures for data collection, processing and storage in disaster as well as normal scenarios?\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\tHow to schedule and coordinate the spatial-temporal movement of EVs in the urban areas for service provisioning and energy supply to CIs considering limited connectivity to cloud and communication network?  \n",

        "title": "Blockchain supported Privacy Aware Ecosystems",
        "description": "The COVID19 Pandemic has highlighted our dependence on online services (from government, e-commerce/retail, and entertainment), often hosted over external cloud computing infrastructure. The users of these services interact with a web interface rather than the larger distributed service provisioning chain that can involve an interlinked group of providers. The data and identity of users are often provided to service provider who may share it (or have automatic sharing agreement) with backend services (such as advertising and analytics). This project aims to the development of compliance-aware cloud application engineering, which can improve transparency of personal data use \u00e2\u20ac\u201c particularly with reference to the European GDPR regulation. Compliance refers to an act of obeying, i.e., any conduct that is based or bounded on (by) a specific rule, policy, order, or request. It is based on different principles, for example, the GDPR legislation sets out seven key principles: Lawfulness, fairness and transparency, purpose limitation, data minimisation, accuracy, storage limitation, integrity and confidentiality (security), and accountability. Although cloud providers continue to provide mitigation strategies to limit/avoid data loss, significant challenges still remain, especially when multiple providers need to work together. The liabilities of any unauthorised access or usage of personal data can have a significant impact on cloud provider revenue, and more importantly cloud provider market reputation (and perception). One of the biggest questions for cloud providers is to understand the sensitivity of the data entrusted upon them by users. Another problem lies with the varied compliance guidelines across different geographic locations. This makes it hard to understand any applicable laws and monitor data flows across different geographic boundaries. Users often entrust their privacy to an organisation, but when the organisation relies on different cloud providers located across different locations, then different privacy and compliance conditions arise. Here lies the risk of data leakage.",

Generative models of this data are useful, since they may be used to generate synthetic training data used in other downstream document analysis tasks, including semantic document layout analysis (semantic segmentation of document images).

For example, a node could have just 2 ports, but the 2 other nodes to which it is connected by direct links could change frequently. Topology changes could be made in response to current traffic demands or periodic. Current research investigates the use of such changing topologies in cloud data centres.

        "description": "Many allocation problems involve matching agents to each other in such a way that their preferences are respected. A classical example is the Stable Marriage problem where n women and n men each have a preference list among the members of the other gender, and the goal is to compute a stable matching. This problem can be solved by the classical Gale-Shapley (1962) algorithm. Matching problems with preferences occur in many other settings (e.g. stable roommates, hospital/residents problem, student-project allocation problem, etc.).\n\nIn this project, you will study settings of matching with preferences where some of the preferences are uncertain (unknown or only partially known) and it is possible to make queries to find out information about the uncertain preferences. The goal is then to use as few queries as possible until a stable allocation can be computed. One can also consider making queries in rounds (where some number of queries can be made in parallel), and the goal is to minimise the number of rounds. For example, a query could mean asking one agent a question such as \"among potential partners a and b, which of the two do you prefer\"?",

        "description": "This project is about scheduling problems where each job consists of two operations: a test whose duration is known in advance, and a main part whose duration becomes known only after the test. The problem can be considered for a single processor that can execute at most one test or main part at any time. The goal is to minimize the average completion time of the jobs. To evaluate an algorithm, it is compared with the optimal offline schedule, which could be computed if all processing times of the jobs' main parts were known in advance. The difficulty for an algorithm lies in deciding in which order to test the jobs and whether to execute next the main part of a tested job or the test of an untested job.\nProblem extensions that could be considered involve scheduling on multiple machines or scheduling jobs with release times (i.e. jobs that become available to be scheduled only at a certain time). For jobs with release times, the sum of response times can be considered as objective function.",

One consequence has been the lionisation of the \u201cplaylist\u201d as a way of framing music.\n\nWhile there\u2019s clearly scope for creativity in this curation of music, many playlists actually seem to be relatively anodyne collections of music that\u2019s \u201csimilar\u201d in either genre (e.g., \u201cballads\u201d), or mood (e.g., \u201cchillout\u201d), or both.\n\nWhat they typically lack is a shape: there\u2019s no need to have a clear start, end, or even sense of climax. Contrast that with the set lists of _live_ gigs. For instance, how often have you sat down and listened to a playlist end-to-end, without doing something else. But you surely notice if you go to a live gig and there isn\u2019t a big (or otherwise satisfying) conclusion.\n\nThis varies by genre and style. The \u201cbig finish\u201d I mention is typical for many kinds of fix-length sets (jazz, pop, classical alike), but clearly not so applicable to night clubs, where climaxes may come in several waves during specific parts of the night. Yet there too the setlist (equivalent) is given a meaningful shape.\n\nMuch music information retrieval (MIR) research has chased this new(ish) concept of the playslist as well as related matters of recommender systems that likewise groups \u201csimilar\u201d items together. Much less attention has been given to the (arguably more interesting) setlist.\n\nExample research questions include:\n-\twithin set questions: which songs were played, in what order, and what are their relative popularity, tempo, length etc.\n-\tbetween set questions: how does artist X\u2019s set list change over time (this can be on the few-month horizon of an album tour or on the 150 year entire history of certain orchestras).\n-\tgenre-specific questions: which instrument solos where in a given jazz standards.\n\nThe data available includes:\n- Simple lists at wiki sites like https://www.setlist.fm/ (> 6 million sets)\n- full concert recordings can be found on sites like youtube (cf.

These operators intelligently boost luminance in the bright parts of the scene in an attempt to \"stretch\" the LDR image luminance range for it to match to the output luminance range of a HDR display. However, these operators do not perform equally well in the -also suppressed- darker regions of LDR images, where block artefacts often appear and camera noise gets significantly amplified. A \"dark-area\" enhancement function would optimally suppress both noise and quantisation artefacts while boosting those dark features in a temporally coherent way. The clipped luminance values in the lower part of the luminance range could be estimated based on notions from image statistics. The theoretical framework could also get inspiration from Laplacian Pyramids and Bilateral Filtering for image processing, or Median Cuts for dark area estimation.",

        "description": "Graph homomorphisms generalise graph colourings, and there are many open problems about the complexity of graph colouring and graph homomorphisms. The complexity usually depends on the mathematical structure of problems. Understanding this structure can be quite hard, but it often depends on polymorphisms, i.e. edge-preserving functions. Thus, research into this topic can be guided by a computational tool that detects special polymorphisms, as this can provide intuition about the structure (or sometimes even completely resolve complexity questions). The difficulty is that finding such polymorphisms involves search in spaces that grow very fast. For example, one might look for a 6-ary edge-preserving function, with specific propertes, from a graph with 7 vertices to a graph with 13 vertices, and the number of such possible functions is too large for a naive search. Thus, a highly optimised software tool (in particular, utilising the inherent symmetry of the search space) is needed to cope with such search spaces. Such a tool can be built, for example, on top of a SAT solver (or another AI search engine).",

        "title": "Music Generation and/or Analysis",
        "description": "<p>This theme is about using methods from artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to compose and/or analyse music. This is a relatively broad theme that can be approached in different ways. A specific project should typically pick a task from <strong>(a)</strong>, a representation / level of description from <strong>(b)</strong> and a musical feature / dimension from <strong>(c)</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>(a) generation vs analysis:</strong> In music <em>generation</em>, the focus is on producing music of a particular style (e.g. Baroque piano music or Trip-Hop beats) or in a particular mood (happy/sad/energetic/...). It does not really matter if it was &quot;composed in the right way&quot; as long as the output sounds as desired. But it turns out to be quite difficult to generate interesting music without incorporating at least a little knowledge about how music works (see e.g. OpenAI Jukebox [1], Music Transformers [2], or Perceivers [3] for the current state of the art). Music <em>analysis</em> focuses on understanding and explaining the inner workings of music. One might e.g. want to transcribe a score from a given audio recording; identify the harmonies or chords being played in a piece; find the typical melodies, motifs, groove patterns etc; or segment a piece into different sections and sub(sub(...)) sections (see e.g. the Tonal Diffusion Model [4] or Pitch Scapes [5]). Of course, music analysis and generation are closely related but in most cases it makes sense to focus on one of them to keep things tractable.</p>\n<p><strong>(b) audio/MIDI/score:</strong> Music can be stored in different formats or <em>representations</em>, which makes a huge difference for the kind of methods that can be used and how difficult certain tasks are. In a raw audio recording, all the subtle information about timbre (how an instruments sounds) etc are preserved, but musical events, such as &quot;a note&quot; are only implicit and can be very hard to extract. A score, on the other hand, represents music on a more abstract level: all the musical events are explicitly listed (and some additional information, such as tempo or expressive information e.g. staccato/legato etc), which greatly simplifies some tasks. The MIDI representation is in between audio and score, events are explicitly represented (via note-on and note-off events) but time is quasi-continuous and other sub-symbolic information (e.g. velocity or pitch bend) can be represented. Other representations that are commonly used for modelling music are spectrograms (which are close to audio) or piano rolls (close to MIDI).</p>\n<p><strong>(c) rhythm/melody/harmony:</strong> Music is multifaceted, but can be roughly thought of as having three dimensions that are used to create the overall experience. <em>Rhythm</em> is about &quot;structuring time&quot;: when does an event/beat/note occur and when not, how salient/loud is the event, how do they group to form larger patterns in time etc. <em>Melody</em> is about sequences of single notes, sounding one after the other \u2013 the thing that a human could (at least in principle) sing and what we might typically remember about a song. <em>Harmony</em> is about combining multiple notes to create more complex sounds and how these complex sounds change and evolve over time. Of course, these three dimensions interact strongly (a melody is embedded into a harmonic context and its notes form a specific rhythm) but it often makes sense to focus on one of them.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Gaussian processes (GPs) are a powerful non-parametric Bayesian approach in machine learning. The essential component that defines a GP is its kernel, which can have parameters that can be trained on the data. Different kernels can be combined to form new kernels with a complex internal structure. However, this <em><strong>structure</strong></em> of a complex kernel <em><strong>cannot</strong></em> be easily learned because the operation of combining multiple kernels is not differentiable. Therefore, currently, the only possibility is to test different structures in an expensive and time-consuming process.</p>\n<p>The goal of this project is to overcome this problem by applying techniques from structure learning. Instead of testing one structure at a time, the operation of combining multiple kernels is relaxed to a continuous space, thus making it differentiable. The resulting meta-learning approach might provide ground-breaking improvements for the application of Gaussian processes in machine learning.</p>",

Computing the smallest number of colors that are needed to proper color a given graph is an NP-hard problem, i.e. most probably there does not exist any exact algorithm that runs in polynomial time in worst-case. However, as the proper coloring problem finds many applications in various contexts, it is important to deal with this problem with various algorithmic approaches, even if they do not always guarantee an optimum output.

The set of labels of an edge represent the different moments in time in which this specific edge is available. Such labeled networks are called temporal networks and they represent networks that are dynamically changing over time. Many problems in standard networks can be appropriately modified to make sense in the context of temporal networks. For instance, while to guarantee connectivity in standard networks we need to have a path between any pair of vertices, in the context of a temporal network we achieve connectivity if there exists a temporal path between any pair of vertices, i.e. a path in which the labels of the edges are increasing. Various further classical 'non-path' graph problems can be naturally extended to the temporal settings, such as Maximum Clique, Minimum Vertex Cover, Maximum Matching. The goal of this project is to implement and evaluate various algorithmic approaches to optimization problems in temporal networks.",

That is, individuals mutate, and thus the network itself mutates as well. In such 'mutating rules' that are interesting in practice, some colors are more 'aggressive' than others, in the sense that these colors mutate more rarely than others (they act as viruses).

        "description": "There is a vast number of parallel programming approaches for shared and distributed memory systems and heterogeneous hardware, reaching from threading with OpenMP, std::threads or oneTBB right through to vectorization, message passing and GPU programming. However, it remains a challenge for software developers to decide which of these approaches is the best fit for an application in terms of performance and sustainability. Since applying these approaches to complex, production-ready applications in a trial-and-error manner is time-intensive and costly, it is advantageous to experiment with different parallelization approaches on qualitatively similar but less complex application prototypes first. This is what the ECP proxy app suite was invented for! The benchmarking suite consists of several mini applications that model typical scientific applications. For each of these mini applications, the suite provides a sequential base line implementation and several parallel implementations, e.g. with OpenMP, MPI or CUDA. The objective of this project is to provide a parallel implementation of the C++-based ECP proxy app HPCCG, a conjugate gradient code, with SYCL. SYCL is a parallel programming standard for unified software development on heterogeneous hardware. The SYCL-based implementation is subjected to a performance analysis. The project can be expanded in several ways, e.g., by a comparative performance analysis, by developing a distributed memory version with Celerity, or by conducting a sustainability evaluation in terms of maintainability metrics such as code size, cyclomatic complexity and performance portability.

To tackle this challenge, several task-parallel programming technologies have been developed to allow for the flexible description of algorithms along their task graphs. For algorithms with dense task graphs, however, task-parallelism is still hard to exploit efficiently since it is programmatically complex to describe and imposes high task dependency resolution overheads during execution. This becomes especially challenging on GPUs since their architecture is not designed for synchronization-heavy applications. The research objective of this project is to port a task-parallel programming framework for GPUs from CUDA to SYCL to allow for its usage on CPUs and GPUs without having to rewrite application code. CUDA is the prevalent model for GPU computing in HPC, while SYCL is a novel parallel programming standard for unified software development on CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs.\n ",

Various probing schemes lead to divergence, where some GPU cores are forced to wait for the worst-case number of probes, and in high density hash tables this can cause significant slowdowns. The student working on this project will investigate and implement various hashing algorithms and analyse their performance on modern GPUs.",

The sequence ends when you reach the number 1 (or 0), or you reach a repeating sequence. E.g. Perfect numbers such as 6 - the proper divisors are 1,2 and 3, which sum to 6. It is still an open problem as to whether all aliquot sequences eventually terminate (with a 1 or a repeating sequence), or whether a sequence can continue infinitely. The growth of these sequence is controlled by mathematical objects called drivers and guides, which regularly mutate. These mutations can be modelled using Markov Chains, and we can analyse the underlying directed graph. The theoretical results can be compared against the practical results which can be scraped from the factor database (factordb.com), and an algorithm can be devised to predict which open aliquot sequences should be the easiest to terminate.",

The key challenges are that drones can be viewed from a much wider range of angles, and are usually small in the image space due to the far distance. The student will adapt existing tracking frameworks and propose new ideas to improve tracking accuracy. Existing dataset such as [3] can be used for training and testing. Our team has delivered a successful project [4] funded by the UK Catapult Network, and successful outcomes may be introduced to surveillance companies. ",

Skeletal motion data, which is represented as joint positions of a human body, has become widely available thanks to the advancement of pose estimation networks [1]. As a result, human activity recognition can be performed effectively using skeletal data as an input. Approaches using recurrent convolutional neural networks to model the spatial and temporal features are shown to be effective [2], while the more advanced graph convolutional neural networks model the features even better [3]. The student will adapt and improve existing networks such that they can model human features better. Public datasets such as [4] will be used for network training and evaluations.

Traditional hand-object interaction modelling directly models the interaction from the input images [1].

Considering the diverse range of these objects, such as stars, satellites, and even space debris, accurately classifying and tracking them is essential for ensuring space sustainability. This not only enhances our understanding of the space environment but also enables us to take proactive measures in managing and mitigating potential risks associated with space debris and other celestial bodies.

It has many applications including register allocation, timetabling, frequency assignment and scheduling. The importance of graph colouring means that there have been a wide range of meta-heuristic algorithms developed so as to quickly secure good, if not optimal, colourings of graphs. Meta-heuristic methodologies employed have included greedy approaches, tabu search, ant colony optimization, chaotic ant swarm, honey bee optimization, firefly algorithms and many others.<br><br>\n\nThis theme can support two projects. \n<UL>\n<LI>The first project concerns <I>decentralized networks</I> whereby any node of the underlying graph only has local knowledge of itself and (the colours of) its neighbours. <I>Decentralized colouring</I> has applications in wireless sensor networks, where each sensor node only has local network knowledge in relation to control, distributed resource management, wireless channel allocation and wakeup scheduling. A decentralized colouring algorithm, called SDGC, is developed in [1] which can operate either synchronously (where all nodes update their colours at the same time) or asynchronously (where nodes update their colours at different times). In [1], the algorithm SDGC is empirically compared with another distributed graph colouring algorithm called FrogSim from [2] on a range of benchmark data-sets. This project is to replicate the research in [1] and to possibly extend it.</LI>\n<LI>The second project is to implement a range of meta-heuristic algorithms from the recent research literature and empirically compare them on the same platform.

        "description": "A recent model of computation, forming part of a new research area known as <I>programmable matter</I>, has been developed whereby the computational goal is to transform a shape on a two-dimensional grid to another shape via a sequence of fundamental operations. In more detail, a shape is a placement of nodes in the cells of a two-dimensional grid and allowable fundamental moves include: rotations, whereby a node rotates 90 degrees clockwise or anti-clockwise around a node in an adjacent grid cell, so long as the cells rotated through and into are empty; and slides, whereby a node in one cell slides into an adjacent cell so long as both cells have nodes in adjacent cells so that these adjacent cells are themselves adjacent. The reference [3] contains full details of the progammable matter model. The basic model has been extended so as to allow additional <I>line-push</I> moves and also so that moves can be made in parallel (references [1] and [2] build upon [3]). Consequently, a computation is a sequence of moves transforming one shape into another and has the potential be visualized.<br><br>\n\nThe primary aim of this project is to develop a simulator so that given two shapes A and B, the simulator will compute a sequence of moves that transform A into B and then show these moves in action via some visual representation. While the simulation should be relatively straightforward, computing the actual sequence of moves is more demanding. Deterministic methods in some models and for some shapes exist but things become more complicated in extended models and for more complex shapes; consequently, heuristic methods might be employable. A secondary aim of the project is to extend the models considered so far and develop both theoretical results for any new models and also the simulator so that computations in new models can be visualized. Extensions might be, for example, the introduction of a new fundamental move, the consideration of basic models within a three-dimensional grid or the consideration of basic models on a specific graph rather than on a two-dimensional grid.",

        "description": "A <I>reconfiguration graph</I> is, roughly speaking, a graph obtained from the feasible solutions to some problem on some fixed structure. For example, take a graph G and consider all the proper colourings of its vertices using 4 colours (so that two adjacent vertices have different colours). The corresponding reconfiguration graph has a vertex for every 4-colouring of G and there is an edge joining two 4-colourings if the colourings are identical except for 1 vertex. Alternatively, the reconfiguration graph of Rubik's cube has a vertex for every setting of Rubik's cube and there is an edge joining two settings if one can be obtained from the other by a single twist of the cube. The study of reconfiguration graphs that emerge in this way is currently an active topic of research.<BR><BR>\n\nHere are some typical results in relation to reconfiguration graphs. Consider the problem of deciding whether given two vertices in a reconfiguration graph (with respect to some problem), there is a path in the reconfiguration graph from one vertex to the other, i.e., the reachability problem. It has been proven that the reachability problem for reconfiguration graphs of 4-colourings of a graph is PSPACE-complete, whereas the reachability problem for reconfiguration graphs of 3-colourings of a graph is solvable in polynomial-time. Consider the problem of computing the diameter of some reconfiguration graph (if it is connected). It has been shown that in the 3-colouring reconfiguration graph of some graph G, the diameter of each connected component is O(|V(G)|<SUP>2</SUP>) but that in the 4-colouring reconfiguration graph of some graph G, the diameter of each connected component can be super-polynomial in |V(G)|.<BR><BR>\n\nThis project is to investigate the use of meta-heuristic methods to answer questions as regards reconfiguration graphs. There exist similar concepts to reconfiguration graphs such as token swapping graphs and sorting networks which can form the basis for similar studies. All details of basic concepts and numerous recent results are given in [3] whereas [2] focusses more on sorting networks. A web survey [1] provides access to lots of papers on reconfiguration problems. ",

Also, in so far as I am aware, there has been no research undertaken so far on obtaining practical algorithms to solve hard problems in relation to reconfiguration graph problems, e.g., although, as stated above, the reachability problem for reconfiguration graphs of 4-colourings of a graph is PSPACE-complete, no-one has yet explored finding an efficient algorithm that provides solutions a lot of the time.

Virtual machines often come in the form of virtual networks with a basic \"star\" graph forming a common such network (where a central \"root\" switch is connected directly to a number of \"leaf\" servers). The data centre provider wants to embed as many virtual networks as possible so as to optimize revenue but so that quality-of-service guarantees can be met. The basic virtualization problem can be abstracted as a graph embedding problem where the graphs have weights (reflecting numerical parameters of the underlying networks). Two illustrative existing virtualization methodologies are Oktopus [1] and SecondNet [2].<br><br>\n\n<I>Server-centric DCNs</I> have been proposed as a paradigm to support the next generation of DCNs as there are problems regarding, for example, scalability for the switch-centric DCNs that form the current paradigm of production DCNs.

        "description": "In datacenters and many other computer systems, it is important to process jobs with minimum waiting times or higher probability of getting service when they cannot wait. The main challenge is how to distribute jobs to severs for processing to achieve good performance. An optimal policy is the Join-the-shortest-queue (JSQ) policy under which an incoming job is assigned to the sever with the least number of jobs. For systems with large number of servers, JSQ has high implementation cost, therefore some low-complexity randomized algorithms were proposed. In this project we will simulate a multi-server system under several load balancing policies that use occupancy details (or the number of waiting jobs) of servers and compare their performance. We will study two types of systems, the first model is the processor-sharing systems (these models process jobs with minimum response time requirements like Youtube or Video calls) and the second type are Erlang loss systems which model call centers and telephone lines. We will particularly investigate near-insensitivity property which means only the average service times influence the performance, but the type of service time distributions does not affect the performance. This property was observed earlier for some policies but there is no thorough investigation of occupancy based policies. The main objective of this project is to investigate validity of near-insensitivity property for several occupancy based policies which was observed in [1] and [2] for processor sharing systems and [3] for Erlang loss systems.\n\n[1] Varun Gupta, Mor Harchol Balter, Karl Sigman, Ward Whitt,``Analysis of join-the-shortest-queue routing for web server farms,\u201d Performance Evaluation, Volume 64, Issues 9\u201312, 2007, Pages 1062-1081.\n[2] T.

Recently in [1] it was shown that it is possible to obtain entanglement distribution rates that do not depend on the distance between the users. This is only true for some network topologies and entanglement distribution protocols. In general, if the distance between users increases then entanglement distribution rate decreases. The main objective of this project is to understand the results of [1] and obtain numerical results presented in [1].\n\nThis project is suitable for an L4 student who has some background on quantum computing (who has already taken either MATH3391 or MATH3111).\n\n\n[1] Patil, A., Pant, M., Englund, D. et al. ``Entanglement generation in a quantum network at distance-independent rate.\u201d npj Quantum Inf 8, 51 (2022). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41534-022-00536-0\n",

        "description": "Wireless sensors are small devices that can be used to detect abnormal events in a given region of interest. In general, sensors collect data from their surroundings and then they send their data to fusion centers that decide the presence or absence of the abnormal activities. To minimize the energy consumption and bandwidth requirements sensors make their own local decisions that will be informed to the fusion center. The count of the local decisions of sensors in favor of the presence of abnormal activities will decide the decision of the fusion center, this method was studied in [2]. In [1], a modified version of the counting rule was analyzed, this method reduces the number of messages transferred by the sensors. The main aim of this project is to understand the results of [2] and obtain numerical results presented in [2]. There is also scope for proposing new methods and studying their performance.\n\nThis project is suitable for an L3 student.\n\n\n\n[1] N. Sriranga, K. G. Nagananda, R. S. Blum, A. Saucan and P. K.
