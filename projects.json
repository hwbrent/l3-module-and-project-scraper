        "description": "An interval temporal network is a network whose edges are active for one or more time intervals and inactive the rest of the time. Work has been done previously on instantaneous connectivity of interval temporal networks, where the network is considered to be connected during a period of time [x,y], if it is connected for all time instances within the continuous time interval [x,y]. This project will look at the implementation of existing and possible development of new approaches to preserve connectivity of an interval temporal network over time (by maintaining a 'bank' of extra edges, available during certain time intervals, which can reconnect the network in case it becomes disconnected).",

The aim of the (Minimum) Temporal Vertex Cover problem is to cover every edge at least once during the lifetime of the temporal graph, where an edge can only be covered by one of its endpoints at a time step when it is active. A more pragmatic variation of the problem, called (Minimum) Sliding Window Temporal Vertex Cover, we are also given a natural number \u00e2\u02c6\u2020, and our aim is to cover every edge at least once in every \u00e2\u02c6\u2020 consecutive time steps. These two problems are extensions of the classical (i.e. static) Minimum Vertex Cover problem to temporal graphs, and have been shown to be computationally hard for arbitrary temporal graphs. The purpose of this project is to look at known approximation algorithms for the two problems and also focus on special classes of input graphs in an effort to derive better ratios.",

With temporal graphs, i.e. graphs that change over time, one needs to revisit the notion of a path and may in fact develop various temporal analogues of a static path. This project will focus on the implementation and development of path finding algorithms for temporal graphs. The basis of the project will involve familiarising yourself and implementing existing work for computing shortest, fastest and foremost temporal paths. You will then progress to studying and exploring reachability problems in temporal graphs, such as Minimizing Reachability Times on Temporal Graphs via Shifting Labels (see work by Deligkas et al.) or Deleting edges to restrict the size of an epidemic in temporal networks (see work by Enright et al.).",

        "description": "Image enhancement techniques (e.g. Transforms, Filters, Operators, etc.) have been used for decades to improve the quality of images to enable better human analysis. This project intends to investigate the effects of such enhancement techniques on learning-based computer vision methods. We know that image processing techniques used to enhance the visual quality of the images do not actually add more information to the images and can only produce more visually pleasing results or extract specific features from images by manipulating information that is already contained within the image. Modern learning-based computer vision techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), however, receive raw images as their input and given enough training data should be able to learn their way around any visual changes in the image. As a result, it would make sense that image processing techniques, while used as data augmentation methods, should not make much of a difference in the actual performance of the neural network but besides intuition, there is little evidence of this in the literature. The parameters of the project will be decided by the student, but the overall goal is to identify how if at all image enhancement techniques can effect the performance of CNNs over various tasks. Experiments are required to identify performance with different image processing methods, different neural network architecture, transfer learning, pre-trained models, training from scratch, etc.",

Retinal OCT captures three-dimensional volumetric data with cross-sectional images (B-scans) to show the details of cellular layers in the retina [2]. Since manual annotation of retinal boundaries is time-consuming, subjective, and prone to error, automatic cell layer segmentation has been an active area of research in recent years [3,4]. However, even the most promising segmentation methods fail in some cases. The main problem is that 3D OCT of each patient consists of 100 to 500 B-scans and failing in correct segmentation of some images leads to problematic 3D reconstruction of the retinal cell layers, needed in subsequent treatment or diagnosis applications. The parameters of the project will be decided by the student but the overall aim of this project is to develop a learning-based supervised classification algorithm capable of categorising each segmented image as either correct or incorrect. The labelled data is available for this task and the performance of the network will be compared against an expert ophthalmologist. ",

Diagnosis of retinal abnormalities is essentially dependant on multimodal data, including 2D and 3D images with basic clinical information. However, current learning-based approaches often relies on large scale labelled data for training, which is oftentimes challenging especially for disease with low occurrence. Moreover, a model trained from dataset with one or a few diseases is unable to detect other unseen diseases, which limits the practical usage of the system in disease screening. This project focuses on a multimodal and multiscale solution for the identification of different diseases through anomaly detection. Different anomaly detection methods can be explored to help identify unseen and unknown diseases by taking advantage of healthy patient data only.\n",

Using state-of-the-art automatic segmentation techniques on in vivo 3D retinal imaging in one of the largest AS cohorts to date, we seek to uncover the full spectrum of retinal alterations in this condition with aid of deep learning algorithms. By uncovering the link between retinal cell rarefaction, foveal morphology, genetic factors, and systemic disease, we hope to shed light on the development of AS in the eye and kidney. This knowledge will have a profound impact on early detection, monitoring, and treatment planning for AS, ultimately improving patient care and outcomes.

        "description": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) show impressive performance when it comes to object detection, localisation and classification. However, these problems become extremely challenging when the scene is cluttered and contains irrelevant information that distracts the neural network. This is even true for humans, as evidenced by puzzle games such as \"Where's Wally?\", where the goal is to find the target in a cluttered scene. The objective of this project is to explore the effects of distractors on the performance of CNNs when attempting tasks such as object detection or semantic segmentation. The parameters of the project will be decided by the student, but the overall goal is to identify how if at all clutter hinders performance. Data can be generated on the fly by artificially introducing clutter into otherwise simple scenes. Where's Wally data can also be used as part of the analysis by identifying which part of the cluttered scene the CNN is paying attention to in presence of distractors.\n",

        "title": "Can surgery revitalize the eyes? ",
        "description": "The macula is a specialised region of the eye in which there is a very high packing density of cones, particularly in its centre, the fovea. The formation of the fovea is characterised by a migration, largely after birth, of the inner retinal layers away from the centre to form a pit with concurrent migration of cone photoreceptors inwards. The inward migration during childhood increases the cone packing density affording good visual acuity through adulthood. The process has been termed foveation and has not thought to be possible other than in development.\n\nA variety of disease and injuries can affect the centre of the fovea, including macular holes.  Full-thickness macular holes (FTMHs) are defects in the foveal centre involving all neural retinal layers. Their estimated prevalence is approximately 3 per 1000.  FTMHs reduce visual acuity and have a significant impact on quality of life. Surgical management with pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) is successful in closing macular holes and improving vision.  The mechanism of visual restoration has always been thought to be due to simple cone re-apposition but careful observation of macular hole patients after surgery suggest that a process analogous to foveation seen earlier in life may be an important process in the healing of macular holes. These findings may have significance in the potential restoration of acuity in other disorders involving the macula and may be amenable to therapeutic interventions.\n\nThis project will use deep learning and image processing methods to examine images pre and postoperatively of patients undergoing macular hole surgery to detect its occurrence and will also look at the association of preoperative and postoperative variables including visual acuity and RPE health, thought to be an important determinant of foveation in utero. External collaborators will be involved in this work.",

        "description": "Using advanced imaging techniques, we can capture cellular-resolution images of the living human retina, which is the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. This is not possible with the \u2018standard\u2019 instruments you may have seen at the optometrist and there are very few research labs with this capability. We can use the images captured by this instrument in a number of important clinical and non-clinical applications, from studying disease to investigating the workings of the human visual system. An important measurement that we need to make is the density of photoreceptor cells, as this is altered in many retinal diseases, having a devastating impact on a person\u2019s sight. Making these measurements accurately can help us understand these diseases better and possibly detect them earlier. But, labelling the large number of cells visible in these images is challenging. Doing this manually is time-consuming and prone to error, and the accuracy of automated approaches is variable and often needs a manual check of the output. This project will investigate two automated methods using neural networks, but unlike other published studies, it will use images from human participants and images generated via simulation [1] both to produce large training datasets and to properly characterise algorithm performance. This will help us to derive better metrics of cell density and arrangement that we can use to analyse images collected from patients with retinal disease.

        "description": "Urban Areas or Cities are largely dependent on infrastructure specifically critical infrastructures (CIs) to provide a quality living standard, public services, economic development and good governance to the society. In emergency situations or in the case of disaster, Electric Vehicles (EVs) can act as mobile service providers wherein they can perform multifaceted roles as energy stores (can be used for charging and discharging of energy to/fro grid), data stores, edge nodes (for computation and processing), roadside communication units (can act as communication devices for data transmission) and many more. EVs can move around the urban areas to supply power to CIs and even act as mobile communication nodes which can provide connectivity. But, before deploying EVs in urban areas for handling emergency services and sustaining basic functionalities for CIs, there are many challenges which must be tackled or some novel solutions are required for the same. This project aims to develop a new framework and novel IoT data management techniques to support the development of next generation applications for restoring power to CIs during disaster situations. In case of disruption of cloud or even edge connectivity, the usage of EVs as an alternative edge-computing infrastructure and roadside units (RSU) as an alternative communication media needs will be investigated.  In this project, EVs can act as such computational chips, which can be utilised for data collection, storage and even processing if required. However, developing an integrated IoT-Edge-Cloud data processing framework and techniques for restoring power supply to CIs, specifically in disaster scenario, are faced with following hard research and technical questions: \r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\tWhat are the core data types, which need to integrate for achieving dynamic decision making as regards to EV mobilization and placement for protecting CIs during disaster situations?\r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\tHow  to constantly monitor and handle the velocity, volume, and variety of IoT data from multiple sensor types (smart meters, temperature, humidity, appliances, light)  and roof-top photovoltaic farms (micro-grids) connected to CIs for building energy demand profiles? \r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\tHow to exploit combined edge-cloud infrastructures for data collection, processing and storage in disaster as well as normal scenarios?\r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\tHow to schedule and coordinate the spatial-temporal movement of EVs in the urban areas for service provisioning and energy supply to CIs considering limited connectivity to cloud and communication network?  \r\n",

        "description": "The COVID19 Pandemic has highlighted our dependence on online services (from government, e-commerce/retail, and entertainment), often hosted over external cloud computing infrastructure. The users of these services interact with a web interface rather than the larger distributed service provisioning chain that can involve an interlinked group of providers. The data and identity of users are often provided to service provider who may share it (or have automatic sharing agreement) with backend services (such as advertising and analytics). This project aims to the development of compliance-aware cloud application engineering, which can improve transparency of personal data use \u00e2\u20ac\u201c particularly with reference to the European GDPR regulation. Compliance refers to an act of obeying, i.e., any conduct that is based or bounded on (by) a specific rule, policy, order, or request. It is based on different principles, for example, the GDPR legislation sets out seven key principles: Lawfulness, fairness and transparency, purpose limitation, data minimisation, accuracy, storage limitation, integrity and confidentiality (security), and accountability. Although cloud providers continue to provide mitigation strategies to limit/avoid data loss, significant challenges still remain, especially when multiple providers need to work together. The liabilities of any unauthorised access or usage of personal data can have a significant impact on cloud provider revenue, and more importantly cloud provider market reputation (and perception). One of the biggest questions for cloud providers is to understand the sensitivity of the data entrusted upon them by users. Another problem lies with the varied compliance guidelines across different geographic locations. This makes it hard to understand any applicable laws and monitor data flows across different geographic boundaries. Users often entrust their privacy to an organisation, but when the organisation relies on different cloud providers located across different locations, then different privacy and compliance conditions arise. Here lies the risk of data leakage.",

The fundamental driver of this change is that renewable energy technologies follow learning curves, which means that with each doubling of the cumulative installed capacity their price declines by the same fraction. The price of electricity from fossil fuel sources however does not follow learning curves so that we should expect that the price difference between expensive fossil fuels and cheap renewables will become even larger in the future. However, the inherent fluctuation and intermittence of RESs may deteriorate the stability and security of power grids. The power output of renewable energy systems (say solar energy) reaches the peak at noon, which coincides with the off-peak loading period and leads to power imbalance in the electric network Energy storage systems can mitigate the problem, but they are very expensive. For this reason, a coordinated control and optimisation of renewable energy systems is required so that the energy can be used efficiently.",

Among their type, Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations are\nused to study systems that range from multi-phase fluid flows in the gas and oil\nindustry to the formation of stars and galaxies. This project aims to\nextend the current Input/Output (I/O) capabilities of the state-of-the-art SPH\nsimulation code under development in the Scientific Computing Group,\nwhich is based on the ExaHyPE-Peano and SWIFT codes.\n\nOn the input side, we expect successful students to build a plugin-based upon\nHDF5, which can read in the mainstream Gadget-2 and SWIFT particle\n'snapshot' files. While the underlying data format is well-documented and relatively\nsimple, there are some fundamental computer science challenges when we read such\nfiles in a large parallel simulation: Concurrent accesses to HDF5 files are slow\n- even though HDF5 is already optimised for supercomputers - and the files\nquickly become so large, that it is impossible to hold them in the main memory.\nHowever, ExaHyPE/SWIFT is built following an octree data paradigm: We run\nthrough a tree top-down and insert particles at the bottom of the tree.\nConsequently, each tree level 'knows' that it will only insert particles from a\nvery limited area. We expect students to develop an in-situ caching/sorting\nalgorithm on the input that re-organises data on-the-fly: Early throughout the\nmesh traversal, the data in the HDF5 file is re-sorted (bucket sort) such that\nparticles residing within a certain cubic domain are enlisted in the file\ncontinuously. This sorting can then be continued recursively (and in parallel)\nsuch that the effective number of particles to be examined per mesh cell\neventually becomes small.\n\nOn the output side, we expect the students to create an HDF5-based output file\nwriter which again writes snapshots which are Gadget-2 and/or SWIFT-compatible.\nOne gamechanger here is that subsequent snapshots in time often differ only\nslightly. SWIFT therefore has established a 'delta' data format, where only\nparticles subject to major changes are dumped. While this is an elegant idea, it\nremains unclear how such major changes - large changes in particle positions,\ne.g. - are identified. In the current code base, the position of the last data\ndump per particle has to be held to make a decision if a particle is to be\nwritten or not. We want the successful student to establish and I/O backend\nwhich accepts all particle data as plain data dump and decides autonomously (and\nin parallel to the running application) if particle data is to be dumped or not,\nanalysing previously written HDF5 data.",

While there is considerable interest in handwritten text recognition (HTR) for commercial, government, and cultural applications there is less focus on non-text annotations: underlines, editorial marks, deletions, doodles, and so on. This applied machine learning project, in the area of document analysis, will explore the use of generative models of raster (image) and/or vector graphic representations of non-text handwritten annotations. Generative models of this data are useful, since they may be used to generate synthetic training data used in other downstream document analysis tasks, including semantic document layout analysis (semantic segmentation of document images). Solutions to this problem have applications in information management and to the digital humanities, particularly in the field of digitized cultural heritage.",

        "description": "<p> Inserting objects into an image that conforms to scene semantics is a challenging and interesting task. Object insertion in images aims to insert a new object into a given scene such that the manipulated scene looks realistic. In recent years, there has been increasing interest in this problem as it can be applied to numerous vision tasks, including but not limited to training data augmentation for object detection, interactive image editing, and manipulating semantic layouts. In the context of object detection, convolutional neural network architecture requires a large volume of training data, and collating such large volumes of data under resource starved conditions (e.g., X-ray imagery, infrared imagery) remains a significant challenge. This work potentially opens up the possibility of using synthetically composed imagery for the object detection task. However, there remains a significant gap between its potential and real-world applications since existing methods focus on modifying a single image while either requiring carefully pre-processed inputs, e.g. segmented objects without backgrounds, or generating objects from a random vector which makes it difficult to control the resulting appearance of the object directly. Potential solutions require, first, determining a location to place an object in the scene and second determining its appearance at the location. This work aims to investigate a solution for synthetic image generation by inserting objects in an image using deep convolutional neural network architectures primarily focus on object detection task. </p>\r\n\r\n<p> This project will require a background reading of recent papers, e.g. at top computer vision conferences/journals (CVPR, ICCV, BMVC, PAMI, IJCV, etc.). </p>\r\n\r\n<p> On successful completion of this project, you will be able to learn/hands-on experience on:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li> Sate-of-the-art deep learning-based Object Detection, Image Classification, Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) architectures. </li>\r\n<li> Synthetic Image Generation methods. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</p>",

        "description": "<p>Due to object detection&#39;s close relationship with image understanding, it has attracted much research attention in recent years. With the rapid development in deep learning, more powerful tools, which can learn semantic, high-level, deeper features, are introduced to address the problems existing in traditional architectures. The deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models behave differently in network architecture, training strategy, and optimisation function. In a supervised learning context, CNN proved to achieve state-of-the-art performance in computer vision applications such as object detection. These algorithms, in general, require a large amount of labelled data, which itself is a very common obstacle since it is time-consuming and costly. Collating such large volumes of labelled data under resource starved conditions (e.g., X-ray imagery, infrared imagery domain) remains a significant challenge. </p> \r\n\r\n<p>In this work, we potentially address this issue by followings:\r\nFirst, we study the relation between the data and object detection performance of the state-of-the-art CNN-based object detection architectures.\r\nSecond, data augmentation is a critical component of training deep learning models. Although data augmentation has significantly improved image classification performance, its potential has not been thoroughly investigated for the object detection task. This work aims to investigate a solution for the most effective method to dynamically learn data augmentation policies for the object detection task.\r\nThird, active learning aims to improve the performance of the task model by selecting the most informative data/samples with a limited budget. We focus on developing an active learning strategy suitable for object detection specific task. </p>\r\n\r\n<p> This project will require a background reading of recent papers, e.g. at top computer vision conferences/journals (CVPR, ICCV, BMVC, PAMI, IJCV, etc.).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOn successful completion of this project, you will be able to learn/hands-on experience on:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li> Sate-of-the-art deep learning-based Object Detection, Image Classification, Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) architectures. </li>\r\n<li> Data Augmentation, Active Learning strategies. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</p>",

We are interested in query algorithms that minimise the expected number of queries, compared to the expected optimal number of queries for the given problem instance. The project involves implementing and experimentally evaluating such algorithms, with the possibility to design new variations of such algorithms and to prove results about them.",

        "description": "Recent developments in networking technology (e.g., free-space optical networks and optical circuit switching) make it possible for computer networks to undergo frequent, controlled topology changes. While the traditional view has been that a network topology that changes as little as possible is ideal, we can now explore network designs that involve frequent, deliberate changes to how the nodes of the network are connected to each other. For example, a node could have just 2 ports, but the 2 other nodes to which it is connected by direct links could change frequently. Topology changes could be made in response to current traffic demands or periodic. Current research investigates the use of such changing topologies in cloud data centres. The goal of the project is to explore and evaluate (by simulations and/or theoretical analysis) how the performance of such ever-changing networks compares to that of static networks.",

        "description": "Reliably detecting anomalies in a given set of images is a\r\ntask of high practical relevance for visual quality inspection, surveillance,\r\nor medical image analysis. In many of the\r\nreal world problems, however, samples from the more unusual classes of interest\r\nare of insufficient sizes to be effectively modelled. Instead, the task of anomaly detection is to be able to identify such cases, by training only on samples considered\r\nto be normal and then identifying these unusual, insufficiently available samples (abnormal) that differ from the learned sample distribution of normality.\r\nFor example is\r\nX-ray screening for aviation or border security \u00e2\u20ac\u201d where anomalous items posing a security threat are not commonly encountered, exemplary data of such\r\ncan be difficult to obtain in any quantity, and the nature of any anomaly posing a potential threat may evolve due to a range of external factors. However,\r\nwithin this challenging context, human security operators are still competent\r\nand adaptable anomaly detectors against new and emerging anomalous threat\r\nsignatures. Motivated by finding the abnormality in a large datasets, particularly in real world application such as X-ray security screening, we leverage existing anomaly detection  deep learning architecture in readily available X-ray image security screening such as SIXRay and OPIXRay. In this approach, we make use of discriminative and generative approach, where the former attempt to model the decision boundary between anomalous samples and nominal samples, and the latter attempt to model the actual distribution of each class from which can then be sampled e.g. to generate new images. Thus, anomaly detection approaches using these models are based on the idea that the anomalies cannot be generated since they do not exist in the training set.  It is hopeful that the \r\nexperimentation over established anomaly detection benchmarks and challenging real-world\r\ndatasets, within the context of X-ray security screening, may shows the unique promise of such a proposed approach.",

These operators intelligently boost luminance in the bright parts of the scene in an attempt to \"stretch\" the LDR image luminance range for it to match to the output luminance range of a HDR display. However, these operators do not perform equally well in the -also suppressed- darker regions of LDR images, where block artefacts often appear and camera noise gets significantly amplified. A \"dark-area\" enhancement function would optimally suppress both noise and quantisation artefacts while boosting those dark features in a temporally coherent way. The clipped luminance values in the lower part of the luminance range could be estimated based on notions from image statistics. The theoretical framework could also get inspiration from Laplacian Pyramids and Bilateral Filtering for image processing, or Median Cuts for dark area estimation.",

        "title": "Music Generation and/or Analysis",
        "description": "<p>This theme is about using methods from artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to compose and/or analyse music. This is a relatively broad theme that can be approached in different ways. A specific project should typically pick a task from <strong>(a)</strong>, a representation / level of description from <strong>(b)</strong> and a musical feature / dimension from <strong>(c)</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>(a) generation vs analysis:</strong> In music <em>generation</em>, the focus is on producing music of a particular style (e.g. Baroque piano music or Trip-Hop beats) or in a particular mood (happy/sad/energetic/...). It does not really matter if it was &quot;composed in the right way&quot; as long as the output sounds as desired. But it turns out to be quite difficult to generate interesting music without incorporating at least a little knowledge about how music works (see e.g. OpenAI Jukebox [1], Music Transformers [2], or Perceivers [3] for the current state of the art). Music <em>analysis</em> focuses on understanding and explaining the inner workings of music. One might e.g. want to transcribe a score from a given audio recording; identify the harmonies or chords being played in a piece; find the typical melodies, motifs, groove patterns etc; or segment a piece into different sections and sub(sub(...)) sections (see e.g. the Tonal Diffusion Model [4] or Pitch Scapes [5]). Of course, music analysis and generation are closely related but in most cases it makes sense to focus on one of them to keep things tractable.</p>\n<p><strong>(b) audio/MIDI/score:</strong> Music can be stored in different formats or <em>representations</em>, which makes a huge difference for the kind of methods that can be used and how difficult certain tasks are. In a raw audio recording, all the subtle information about timbre (how an instruments sounds) etc are preserved, but musical events, such as &quot;a note&quot; are only implicit and can be very hard to extract. A score, on the other hand, represents music on a more abstract level: all the musical events are explicitly listed (and some additional information, such as tempo or expressive information e.g. staccato/legato etc), which greatly simplifies some tasks. The MIDI representation is in between audio and score, events are explicitly represented (via note-on and note-off events) but time is quasi-continuous and other sub-symbolic information (e.g. velocity or pitch bend) can be represented. Other representations that are commonly used for modelling music are spectrograms (which are close to audio) or piano rolls (close to MIDI).</p>\n<p><strong>(c) rhythm/melody/harmony:</strong> Music is multifaceted, but can be roughly thought of as having three dimensions that are used to create the overall experience. <em>Rhythm</em> is about &quot;structuring time&quot;: when does an event/beat/note occur and when not, how salient/loud is the event, how do they group to form larger patterns in time etc. <em>Melody</em> is about sequences of single notes, sounding one after the other \u2013 the thing that a human could (at least in principle) sing and what we might typically remember about a song. <em>Harmony</em> is about combining multiple notes to create more complex sounds and how these complex sounds change and evolve over time. Of course, these three dimensions interact strongly (a melody is embedded into a harmonic context and its notes form a specific rhythm) but it often makes sense to focus on one of them.</p>",

The essential component that defines a GP is its kernel, which can have parameters that can be trained on the data. Different kernels can be combined to form new kernels with a complex internal structure.

Therefore, currently, the only possibility is to test different structures in an expensive and time-consuming process.</p>\n<p>The goal of this project is to overcome this problem by applying techniques from structure learning. Instead of testing one structure at a time, the operation of combining multiple kernels is relaxed to a continuous space, thus making it differentiable.

Adaptivity seeks to put the computation effort where it makes the biggest difference, in accuracy and speed.

However, as the proper coloring problem finds many applications in various contexts, it is important to deal with this problem with various algorithmic approaches, even if they do not always guarantee an optimum output.

Such labeled networks are called temporal networks and they represent networks that are dynamically changing over time. Many problems in standard networks can be appropriately modified to make sense in the context of temporal networks. For instance, while to guarantee connectivity in standard networks we need to have a path between any pair of vertices, in the context of a temporal network we achieve connectivity if there exists a temporal path between any pair of vertices, i.e. a path in which the labels of the edges are increasing. Various further classical 'non-path' graph problems can be naturally extended to the temporal settings, such as Maximum Clique, Minimum Vertex Cover, Maximum Matching. The goal of this project is to implement and evaluate various algorithmic approaches to optimization problems in temporal networks.",

        "description": "Modern GPUs from both Nvidia and AMD offer enormous amounts of processing power, yet a number of algorithms are deemed unsuitable for computation on GPUs as they require random memory accesses, such as those required to insert and retrieve entries in hash tables. Various probing schemes lead to divergence, where some GPU cores are forced to wait for the worst-case number of probes, and in high density hash tables this can cause significant slowdowns. The student working on this project will investigate and implement various hashing algorithms and analyse their performance on modern GPUs.",

The sequence ends when you reach the number 1 (or 0), or you reach a repeating sequence. E.g. Perfect numbers such as 6 - the proper divisors are 1,2 and 3, which sum to 6. It is still an open problem as to whether all aliquot sequences eventually terminate (with a 1 or a repeating sequence), or whether a sequence can continue infinitely. The growth of these sequence is controlled by mathematical objects called drivers and guides, which regularly mutate. These mutations can be modelled using Markov Chains, and we can analyse the underlying directed graph. The theoretical results can be compared against the practical results which can be scraped from the factor database (factordb.com), and an algorithm can be devised to predict which open aliquot sequences should be the easiest to terminate.",

For example, you could explore how instance representations and spatial layouts may effect on end-users\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 trust, and what are the best visualisation strategies to increase their trust in the output of the ML algorithms.",

Here, the movement of a person is considered as a time series of 2D position. Such data is usually captured by overhead cameras and extracted by pre-trained tracking networks [1]. The movement is affected by many factors such as the surrounding people and the environment. Deep learning architectures such as the convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) has shown to be effective in the modelling the spatial and temporal feature of the movement trajectories [2, 3]. More advanced architectures using graph convolutional neural networks (GCN) can incorporate the trajectories of nearby people to produce state-of-the-art results [4]. The student will adapt and improve a network to model the trajectory better, and perform experiments to evaluate the proposed system. The results in this project can inform real-world applications such as predicting people movement trajectories, detecting violations of social distancing under COVID-19 and identifying abnormal people behaviour.",

The key challenges are that drones can be viewed from a much wider range of angles, and are usually small in the image space due to the far distance.

        "description": "<I>Graph colouring</I> is a fundamental problem in Computer Science and is often mentioned as an archetypal NP-hard problem. It has many applications including register allocation, timetabling, frequency assignment and scheduling. The importance of graph colouring means that there have been a wide range of meta-heuristic algorithms developed so as to quickly secure good, if not optimal, colourings of graphs. Meta-heuristic methodologies employed have included greedy approaches, tabu search, ant colony optimization, chaotic ant swarm, honey bee optimization, firefly algorithms and many others.<br><br>\n\nThis theme can support two projects. \n<UL>\n<LI>The first project concerns <I>decentralized networks</I> whereby any node of the underlying graph only has local knowledge of itself and (the colours of) its neighbours. <I>Decentralized colouring</I> has applications in wireless sensor networks, where each sensor node only has local network knowledge in relation to control, distributed resource management, wireless channel allocation and wakeup scheduling. A decentralized colouring algorithm, called SDGC, is developed in [1] which can operate either synchronously (where all nodes update their colours at the same time) or asynchronously (where nodes update their colours at different times). In [1], the algorithm SDGC is empirically compared with another distributed graph colouring algorithm called FrogSim from [2] on a range of benchmark data-sets. This project is to replicate the research in [1] and to possibly extend it.</LI>\n<LI>The second project is to implement a range of meta-heuristic algorithms from the recent research literature and empirically compare them on the same platform.

        "description": "A recent model of computation, forming part of a new research area known as <I>programmable matter</I>, has been developed whereby the computational goal is to transform a shape on a two-dimensional grid to another shape via a sequence of fundamental operations. In more detail, a shape is a placement of nodes in the cells of a two-dimensional grid and allowable fundamental moves include: rotations, whereby a node rotates 90 degrees clockwise or anti-clockwise around a node in an adjacent grid cell, so long as the cells rotated through and into are empty; and slides, whereby a node in one cell slides into an adjacent cell so long as both cells have nodes in adjacent cells so that these adjacent cells are themselves adjacent. The reference [3] contains full details of the progammable matter model. The basic model has been extended so as to allow additional <I>line-push</I> moves and also so that moves can be made in parallel (references [1] and [2] build upon [3]). Consequently, a computation is a sequence of moves transforming one shape into another and has the potential be visualized.<br><br>\n\nThe primary aim of this project is to develop a simulator so that given two shapes A and B, the simulator will compute a sequence of moves that transform A into B and then show these moves in action via some visual representation. While the simulation should be relatively straightforward, computing the actual sequence of moves is more demanding. Deterministic methods in some models and for some shapes exist but things become more complicated in extended models and for more complex shapes; consequently, heuristic methods might be employable. A secondary aim of the project is to extend the models considered so far and develop both theoretical results for any new models and also the simulator so that computations in new models can be visualized. Extensions might be, for example, the introduction of a new fundamental move, the consideration of basic models within a three-dimensional grid or the consideration of basic models on a specific graph rather than on a two-dimensional grid.",

        "title": "Solving reconfiguration problems using meta-heuristic methods",
        "description": "A <I>reconfiguration graph</I> is, roughly speaking, a graph obtained from the feasible solutions to some problem on some fixed structure. For example, take a graph G and consider all the proper colourings of its vertices using 4 colours (so that two adjacent vertices have different colours). The corresponding reconfiguration graph has a vertex for every 4-colouring of G and there is an edge joining two 4-colourings if the colourings are identical except for 1 vertex. Alternatively, the reconfiguration graph of Rubik's cube has a vertex for every setting of Rubik's cube and there is an edge joining two settings if one can be obtained from the other by a single twist of the cube. The study of reconfiguration graphs that emerge in this way is currently an active topic of research.<BR><BR>\n\nHere are some typical results in relation to reconfiguration graphs. Consider the problem of deciding whether given two vertices in a reconfiguration graph (with respect to some problem), there is a path in the reconfiguration graph from one vertex to the other, i.e., the reachability problem. It has been proven that the reachability problem for reconfiguration graphs of 4-colourings of a graph is PSPACE-complete, whereas the reachability problem for reconfiguration graphs of 3-colourings of a graph is solvable in polynomial-time. Consider the problem of computing the diameter of some reconfiguration graph (if it is connected). It has been shown that in the 3-colouring reconfiguration graph of some graph G, the diameter of each connected component is O(|V(G)|<SUP>2</SUP>) but that in the 4-colouring reconfiguration graph of some graph G, the diameter of each connected component can be super-polynomial in |V(G)|.<BR><BR>\n\nThis project is to investigate the use of meta-heuristic methods to answer questions as regards reconfiguration graphs. There exist similar concepts to reconfiguration graphs such as token swapping graphs and sorting networks which can form the basis for similar studies. All details of basic concepts and numerous recent results are given in [3] whereas [2] focusses more on sorting networks. A web survey [1] provides access to lots of papers on reconfiguration problems. ",

Also, in so far as I am aware, there has been no research undertaken so far on obtaining practical algorithms to solve hard problems in relation to reconfiguration graph problems, e.g., although, as stated above, the reachability problem for reconfiguration graphs of 4-colourings of a graph is PSPACE-complete, no-one has yet explored finding an efficient algorithm that provides solutions a lot of the time.

For some concrete versions of such projects, see other projects of Professor Stewart.</I>]<BR><BR>\n\nComputationally hard problems, usually defined as those problems the solution of which is NP-hard, cannot be efficiently solved exactly unless P = NP. Many of them are, or involve, combinatorial optimization problems where we are looking to find the minimum or maximum value of some property, e.g., the graph colourability problem, the graph independent set problem, the travelling salesman problem, the knapsack problem, the longest path in a graph problem, and so on. In practice, we generally work with meta-heuristic algorithms that efficiently yield approximate but decent solutions and work pretty well a lot of the time.<BR><BR>\n\nThere is a vaste range of meta-heuristic algorithms available many of which are inspired by nature, e.g., genetic algorithms, ant colony optimization, particle swarm algorithms, artificial bee colony algorithms, cuckoo search, firefly algorithms, ...: the list is very long (some of these algorithms are listed <A HREF = \"http://fcampelo.github.io/EC-Bestiary/\", target = \"_blank\">here</A>). These meta-heuristic algorithms have been applied to solve many applied problems across computer science and engineering.<BR><BR>\n\nFor a project within this theme, a student should find a (recent) paper in a journal or conference and meet with Professor Stewart to discuss a possible project based around the paper. At the least, the project would be to implement the algorithms within the paper and replicate the results obtained. An added bonus would be the implementation of a previously unimplemented algorithm that out-performs the state-of-the-art. However, the aims of any project will ultimately depend upon the paper and the context.<BR><BR>\n\nThe above might sound straightforward but things are always more complicated than they sound. For example: sometimes involved theory needs to be comprehended so as to understand an algorithm; sometimes a paper might not be well written and might be vague (or even incomprehensible) as regards key issues; sometimes data-sets from the paper might not be readily available; and so on. But there is always plenty of scope to dig deep into a topic and work near the boundaries of current research.<BR><BR>\n\nFor a project within this theme, a student should find a (relatively recent) paper in a journal or conference proceedings and meet with Professor Stewart to discuss a possible project around the paper.

Compared to traditional filter lists, the use of perceptual signals is believed to be less prone to an arms race with web publishers and ad networks. We demonstrate that this may not be the case. We describe attacks on multiple perceptual ad-blocking techniques, and unveil a new arms race that likely disfavors ad-blockers. Unexpectedly, perceptual ad-blocking can also introduce new vulnerabilities that let an attacker bypass web security boundaries and mount DDoS attacks.\nWe first analyze the design space of perceptual ad-blockers and present a unified architecture that incorporates prior academic and commercial work. We then explore a variety of attacks on the ad-blocker's detection pipeline, that enable publishers or ad networks to evade or detect ad-blocking, and at times even abuse its high privilege level to bypass web security boundaries.\nOn one hand, we show that perceptual ad-blocking must visually classify rendered web content to escape an arms race centered on obfuscation of page markup. On the other, we present a concrete set of attacks on visual ad-blockers by constructing adversarial examples in a real web page context. For seven ad-detectors, we create perturbed ads, ad-disclosure logos, and native web content that misleads perceptual ad-blocking with 100% success rates. In one of our attacks, we demonstrate how a malicious user can upload adversarial content, such as a perturbed image in a Facebook post, that fools the ad-blocker into removing another users' non-ad content.\nMoving beyond the Web and visual domain, we also build adversarial examples for AdblockRadio, an open source radio client that uses machine learning to detects ads in raw audio streams.",

        "description": "Browser extensions enrich users' browsing experience, e.g., by blocking unwanted advertisements on websites. To perform these functions, users must grant certain permissions during the installation process. These permissions, however, give very limited information about the fact that they allow the extension to access user's personal data and browsing behaviour, posing security and privacy risks. To understand users' awareness of these privileges and the associated threats, we conducted an online survey with 353 participants, focusing on users' attitudes, knowledge, and preference toward extensions' permission requests. We found that users report interest in seeking information, and trust the developers but do little to protect their data. They have limited knowledge about the technical abilities of browser extensions and prefer permission statements that evoke a clear mental model. Based on our findings we derive recommendations for the improvement of browser extension permission dialogues through clear language, technical improvements and distinct responsibilities.",

        "description": "Analysis of 3D volumetric images from medical CT scans is often expensive in terms of radiologist and surgeon time, and often leads to missed or incorrect diagnosis in difficult cases. Automated identification and detection of anomalous regions may lead to improved clinical diagnosis. There are large publicly available medical CT datasets, such as on the cancer imaging archive, however these are often unlabelled and difficult to process due to large file sizes being unable to fit onto GPU memory. The field of anomaly detection is itself a difficult machine learning problem, relating to estimating the density of the underlying data distribution given a discrete set of observations. Density estimation is itself challenging due to a classic ill-defined bias/variance trade-off problem, where anomaly detection approaches generally arise from the fields of manifold learning or reconstructive approaches with a local measure of surprise.\n\nThe aim of this project is to design a bespoke 3D anomaly detection architecture for medical CT data, which highlights locally anomalous regions. This is very challenging given the huge amount of variation within healthy human anatomy. Therefore it is proposed to refine the anomalous space based on application-specific geometric priors (knee fractures as faint/thin lines in orthopaedic knee CT) and/or radiodensity priors imposed from the Hounsfield scale, for example an adrenal tumor with a radiodensity of less than 10 Hounsfield Units (HU) is fatty in composition and almost certainly a benign adrenal adenoma. Similarly anomalous fractures occur at the site of bone, which has 300-400 HU (cancellous) or 1800-1900 (cortical) therefore most soft tissue and other information can be immediate discarded. ",
